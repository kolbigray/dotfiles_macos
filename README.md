Dotfiles and setting to streamline my Mac setup. 

I use multiple computer setups for my daily programming and productivity workflow and I wanted to find an easier way to keep
all of my setups the same. I also wanted to streamline future set-ups of any newer computers I might get. I learned about
dotfiles and here I am setting up a folder full of dotfiles to accomplish this. 

I also took this fantastic course on dotfiles on udemy... [Dotfile Course](https://dotfiles.eieio.xyz).
