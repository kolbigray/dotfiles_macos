# dotfiles_macos
These are the dotfile settings that I am using as of 1/10/2022 across all of my Macs. 

I use multiple computer setups for my daily programming and productivity workflow and I wanted to find an easier way to keep
all of my setups the same. I also wanted to streamline future set-ups of any newer computers I might get. I learned about
dotfiles and here I am setting up a folder full of dotfiles to accomplish this. 

To keep everything fresh, my "HQ" workstation is an M1 Mac Mini that hosts the Main dotfiles. All app preferences, profiles, themes, colors, etc, are set on this computer and those dotfiles are all pushed to this repo where I have an automation set up so that my laptops and other iMac pull the updated files and update things on each individual device. 

I've only scratched the surface with dotfiles so I'm looking into some other cool things like a custom SSH config, using a tool like GNU Snow or Ansible for dotfile management, and making some configurations to my dotfiles so that my setup is cool like the other ones shared on this site! 

I also took this fantastic course on dotfiles on udemy... [Dotfile Course](https://dotfiles.eieio.xyz).
